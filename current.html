    <p> Have you been trained in offensive driving? Publically transport firepower to protect the island in this railway mangement meets tower defense game! <br><br>
        Trolley Problems: Ethical Wreckage is a fast paced, rougelite, tower defense like game where you control a Tram system, using it to defend against hordes of autonomous vehicles. As the game progresses, you obtain more and more
        items to place on top of the trams, which either deal damage to the enemies or give special buffs. You also obtain more and more lines, stations, and trams to place. <br><br>

        I was responsible for much of the enemy behavior, many of the art assets for the scooters, items, and the trolleys themselves. In addition, I am responsible for overall game balance.
